## üìä System Verification

### Database Records
- **14 ingredients** (8 trackable, 6 untrackable)
- **30 products** with complete recipes
- **33 product-ingredient relationships**
- **8 ingredient inventory records**
- **65 demo orders** with 204 order items
- **47 daily product metrics**
- **502 ingredient usage records**

### Functional Testing
- ‚úÖ Model relationships working correctly
- ‚úÖ Inventory service operations verified
- ‚úÖ Order processing workflow tested
- ‚úÖ Stock deduction for trackable items
- ‚úÖ Usage recording for untrackable items
- ‚úÖ Low stock detection functional
- ‚úÖ Transaction audit trail working
- ‚úÖ Filament admin interface accessible

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights
